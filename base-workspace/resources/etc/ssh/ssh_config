# This is the ssh client system-wide configuration file.  See
# ssh_config(5) for more information.  This file provides defaults for
# users, and the values can be changed in per-user configuration files
# or on the command line.

# Configuration data is parsed as follows:
#  1. command line options
#  2. user-specific file
#  3. system-wide file
# Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.
# Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the
# configuration file, and defaults at the end.

# Site-wide defaults for some commonly used options.  For a comprehensive
# list of available options, their meanings and defaults, please see the
# ssh_config(5) man page.


# ssh(1) obtains configuration data from the following sources in the following order:
#
#       1.   command-line options
#       2.   user's configuration file (~/.ssh/config)
#       3.   system-wide configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config)
#
# For each parameter, the first obtained value will be used.  The configuration files contain sections separated
# by “Host” specifications, and that section is only applied for hosts that match one of the patterns given in the
# specification.  The matched host name is the one given on the command line.
#
# Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used, more host-specific declarations should be given near
# the beginning of the file, and general defaults at the end.
